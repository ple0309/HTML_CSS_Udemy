Media Queries: To keep different design for different devices we used media queries. We also used media queries to keep responsive design for a website or web page.

Diffrenet types of media:
    .All
    .Print
    .Screen(mobile, tablet, laptop etc)
    .Speech

Example:
@media screen and (max-width: 800px)
.jaden{
    width: 60%;
    background-color: red;
}


1. Screen width with 650px and down)
@media screen and (max-width: 650px)
{
    You code....
}

2. Screen width 650px and up
@media screen and (min-width: 650px){
    You code...
}

3. Screen width 750px and up
@media screen and (min-width: 750px){
    You code...
}

4. Laptops OR desktops screen width with 992px and up
@media screen and (min-width: 992px)
{
    Your CSS code...
}

5. Extra large laptops and desktops screen width 1200px and up
{
    Your CSS code...
}


Explanation:
    1) Desktop Styles: a screen width greater than 768px. The container is set to 80% width with a margin and padding.

    2) Tablet Styles (768px and below): devices with a maximum width of 768px. The container width is adjusted to 90%.

    3) Mobile Styles( 576px and below): Target devices with a maximum width of 576px. The container width is set to 100%.


    @media (max-width: 768px)
    {
        .container {
            width: 90%;
        }
    }

    @media (max-width: 576px)
    {
        .container{
            width: 100%;
            padding: 10px;
        }
    }

    Explanation:
    Responsive Design using Media Queries:

    - Tablet Styles (768px and below): The container width is adjusted to 90% to ensure better readability and spacing on smaller screens.

    - Mobile Styles (576px and below): The container width is set to 100% to make sure it occupies the full width of the viewport, and the padding is reduced to provide more space for content.
